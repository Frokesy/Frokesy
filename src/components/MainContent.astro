    <p>
      My journey into web development began in high school in 2017 during a
      computer science class where we were introduced to the basics of HTML and
      CSS. I was captivated by how a few lines of code could create visually
      appealing web pages. This initial intrigue drove me to learn more,
      eventually leading me to build a website for my school (a bold move that I
      still look back on with amazement).

      The experience was so enjoyable that it fueled my desire to delve deeper
      into front-end development. Today, I remain passionate about this field,
      constantly staying updated with the latest frameworks, technologies, and
      libraries. Over the years, I've dedicated myself to delivering
      pixel-perfect, responsive, and dynamic designs for myself, clients and startups.
      I've also learned the importance of writing well-optimized, clean code,
      which has earned me recognition among my peers.

      When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing, watching, and analyzing football. I
      also indulge in console, video, and mobile games. During tough and
      confusing times, I find relaxation and inspiration in listening to
      motivational podcasts.
